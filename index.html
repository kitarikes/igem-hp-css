      <h3> Poster Template </h3>
      <p> This poster template will let you create an interactive poster! The poster is divided in two parts: the visual
        overview on the left and the documentation on the right. The visual overview is broken down into sections that
        the user can click on. When a user clicks on a poster section in the visual overview, the documentation on the
        right will display the text and graphics associated with this section of the poster. You can find the
        documentation on how to use this template, as well as an example here: <a

                </h1>
                <p>
                  it is treated by the activated sludge method and other methods. It is easy to introduce E. coli into this system. We were considering a phosphorus recovery method using the equipment we created, but we began to consider introducing it into our existing technology.
                </p>
                <h1>・Rebirth as Yellow Phosphorus</h1>
                <p>We learned how the current method of phosphorus recovery, the MAP method, works because it is expensive to maintain the equipment and the price of recycled phosphorus is more expensive than that obtained from phosphorus ore. Therefore, we began to think about reusing it as yellow phosphorus, which is relatively expensive.</p>
                <h1>・The State of Malnutrition</h1>
                <p>We've learned that Japan is facing more of a problem of poor nutrition than eutrophication. Due to improvements in Japan's sewage environment, the amount of phosphorus released into the environment is decreasing. Some organizations want to release a certain amount of phosphorus to produce good, seafood.</p>
